# midi-to-fnf

just like nyx's version, this converts midi files into fnf charts.

it has a few differences, though.



## usage

just follow the directions given on the command line window.

your midi file should be only 1 channel, where C5-F5 is player1 and C6-F6 is player2.
if you want a trail on a note, just make it any length. otherwise, make the note as short as possible.
i used fl studio for testing.
