# oops

it turns out SNIFF exists which literally does what this is supposed to and a bit more. so rip

# midi-to-fnf

just like nyx's version, this converts midi files into fnf charts.

it has a few differences, though.



## usage

just follow the directions given on the command line window.

your midi file should be only 1 channel, where C5-D#5 is player1 and C6-D#6 is player2.
if you want a trail on a note, just make it any length. otherwise, make the note no more than the note length threshold
(cuts off note trails that are short enough).
the camera will focus on whoever has the most notes for the section.
tested in fl studio and ableton.
